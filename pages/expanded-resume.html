<p>Early in 2018, after receiving an urgent request for help from my previous manager at 
  <a href="https://www.blackboard.com/index.html">Blackboard, Inc</a>, I re-joined the team as a Senior Site Reliability 
  Engineer. Blackboard was in the midst of some organizational changes which shifted some very large and exciting mass 
  communication platforms to the local office.</p>

<p>I was a team lead that managed 3 separate products, all Linux based. As a suite, they annually send over 2 billion 
  messages (Phone, SMS, Email, Push to Apps) and continue to grow. All of these products exist in Amazon Web Services 
  cloud and has granted me a wonderful learning opportunity. With the growing number of tragedies and the need for 
  fast and reliable mass communication in the K-12 market, the focus was on my team to make sure this product performs 
  above and beyond customer expectations. The only way I could see a team of 3 doing all of this, was by focusing on 
  automation to reduce cost, toil, time to recover while adding smart tools and metrics to broaden our understanding 
  of these applications and how we can tune them to be even better.</p>

<p>I worked at <a href="http://www.omniti.com/">OmniTI</a> Computer Consulting as a Site Reliability Engineer. 
  At OmniTI, we hosted websites and databases for external clients on our own branded fork of Solaris/Illumos 
  called <a href="https://omnios.omniti.com/">OmniOS</a>. From security patches to deployment to system life cycle, 
  we maintained all hosting responsibilities. Being in such a unique environment taught me a lot of self-discovery 
  skills, where there is not always a well-defined answer but I still need to resolve the problem in order to make our 
  selves and our clients happy. I have also greatly enjoyed contributing and supporting an open source project that is 
  used by many the world over. It gives me great satisfaction to see the community take off and build from what OmniTI 
  had envisioned.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Before joining OmniTI, I worked for <a href="http://www.blackboard.com/index.html">Blackboard, Inc</a>., as a Senior 
  DevOps/Systems Administrator within their K-12 Content Management Services Division, with my primary focus on five 
  legacy products housed in a separate datacenter. At Blackboard, I learned a great deal and been taught how crucial 
  up-time is to a business’s image and overall success. </p>

<p>The environments I worked with supported thousands of daily visitors and users. This was a huge environment with many 
  complexities, non-standard oddities, all with the constant threat of being a high visibility DDoS target. 
  In my pursuit of keeping with Blackboard’s goal of near perfect up-time, I turned a hard situation into a great 
  learning experience for me. There was barely a day that went by that we are not fixing some new issue, it can be very 
  overwhelming at times as we were in charge of everything from server layer to storage to network and virtualization, 
  but also extremely rewarding.</p>

<p> I tell you all this because I want you to understand that I had taken this environment as a personal challenge to 
  improve my own skills. To that end, I built Ansible, Python, and Bash scripts to automate the environment such as 
  setting up LDAP on over 200 Linux hosts. I wrote a Python script that self-heals a flaw in one of our High-Availability
  file storing solutions. When I joined in July of 2017, I discovered their Nagios instance that had over 600 critical
  errors, I fixed all those issues so that Nagios was down to only 2 outstanding problems. When we repeatedly were 
  taken down by DDoS and had no logging infrastructure to review what occurred, I took it upon myself to install 
  Logstash and record all traffic, which led to us being able to defend ourselves much more effectively, while shutting
  down a lot of dangerous internal communication that did not need to be occurring. Within a few months of working in 
  this position, I had become a primary source of knowledge and taken on a leadership role within our small group.</p>

<p>There are many people that would look at a situation like this and run away, or bury their head in the sand and just 
  wait until the product is shut down, but I reject that line of thinking. The only way to make my job easier was to fix 
  the problems, nothing else would suffice and nothing else would meet the goal of providing as close to perfect up-time 
  as possible. I look forward to the next challenge out there on my life’s journey.</p>

<p>For about 3 years,  I worked at <a href="https://www.zedxinc.com/">ZedX Inc</a> - Now owned by BASF - 
  a high-precision meteorological/agricultural based information systems company. In my time at ZedX, I went from a Junior Administrator 
  to Systems Manager, responsible for all parts of our network, hardware, linux servers, databases, application performance, 
  and desktops. At ZedX we almost exclusively used Linux and open source technology to make our products and meet our 
  business needs.
 </p>

<p>Despite being a small company, I managed an enterprise level data center comprised of over 100 Virtual and physical 
  machines. We also stored over 100 TBs of data for our applications, the majority of that resides on our Netapp SAN. 
  We are able to guarantee over 99.9% uptime to all of our customers using our 24/7 web products while keeping a heavy 
  hand in research and development of new technologies.</p>

<p> At ZedX, I worked extensively to implement automation, auto-recovery, smart alerts, industry-standard security 
  practices, and increase the ability for our developers to do their work. I loved the challenge of working for a 
  small company that forces one to be flexible and learn many different technologies, positions, and responsibilities. 
  I believe my work at ZedX gave me a rock solid foundation and an incredible aptitude to take on any challenge that 
  comes my way.</p>
