<article>
<p>My name is Tom Stewart and if you are viewing this then I have probably applied to work for you in some way 
  whether that be a full-time position or a contract/freelance type of agreement. I prefer a work environment 
  that keeps me learning at my edges and always pushing forward with technology. If I am not actively engaged 
  in a project, I will be working on planning the next one. And when the work is done and there is nothing for 
  me to do, I fill my remaining time with <a href="pages/side-projects.html">creative pursuits</a>. I would like to apply 
  this enthusiasm to focus on a project and work with your team to drive success for us all.</p>

<p>I enjoy challenges and a unique work experience. I am battle hardened with diving into complex environments and 
  figuring out how they work and then finding ways to improve them for the company&#8217;s and customers satisfaction. 
  My attitude towards getting great work accomplished in a speedy manor plus my background in large diverse (mostly 
  Linux) system administration, scripting, automation, SRE best practices, make me a great asset to any team. I am a 
  flexible worker that can work independently and achieve great results, but I also value and encourage a strong team 
  focused environment for those times when things are not working well. It is paramount to have trust between colleagues
   that we can solve any problem together.</p>
